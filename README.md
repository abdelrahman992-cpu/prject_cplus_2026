Project Title: Student Management System

Project Description
The Student Management System is a simple console-based application developed using C++ that demonstrates the basic concepts of programming, including variables, conditions, loops, functions, and structs. The project allows users to input student details, store them in a structure, and display the information based on
certain conditions.

Concepts Covered
Variables
The program uses variables to store data such as student name, age, grade, and ID. For example, integers are used for age and ID, while strings or arrays are used for the student's name.

Conditions (if-else statements)
The program includes conditions to check if the student's grade qualifies for a certain classification. For instance, the program can check if a student's grade is above a
certain threshold and print a message such as "Passed" or "Failed”.

Loops
A loop is used to allow the user to enter multiple student details without restarting the program. For or while loop can be employed to ask the user to enter data for several students.

Functions
Functions are used to organize the code into manageable blocks. There are functions for adding student information, displaying details, and calculating statistics such as average grade. (Each function is designed to handle a specific task)

Struct
A struct is defined to represent a student. The structure contains fields for storing a student's name, ID, grade, and age. This helps in grouping related data together for easy management.

Example Program Flow
The program starts by displaying a menu with options to

1.	Add student information
2.	View all student records
3.	Calculate average grade
4.	Exit the program

Users can add multiple students, and their information will be stored in an array of structs.
 
Each student's grade is checked against predefined conditions to classify them as "Excellent," "Good," or "Needs Improvement”.

The user can view the details of all students or calculate the average grade of all students

Features

Add Student: The user can input student information, which is stored in a struct

Display All Students: The program displays the details of all entered students
